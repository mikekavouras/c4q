          <h1>Baseball Is Life</h1>

          <p>
            You're a die hard Mets fan and everyone knows. You can't remember
            the last time your socks weren't blue and orange. You've had
            season passes for the past 3 years, and before that you would
            sneak into games with your brother, Joe. Due to recent life
            events, you now have less time to devote to The Mets, however,
            your love remains strong.
          </p>

          <p>
            Being the great programmer that you are, you decide make your
            world a little bit easier. You head to Home Depot to buy some
            Philips Hue light bulbs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whenever The Mets are about to play, you want to make sure that
            the mood is set. You write a program that changes all the lights
            in your house to glow orange and blue. Also, you want to receive
            a text message at the same time, letting you know that the show
            is about to start.
