          <h1>Baseball Is Life</h1>

          <p>
            You're a die hard Mets fan and everyone knows. You can't remember
            the last time your socks weren't blue and orange. You've had a
            season pass for the last three years, and before that you would
            sneak into games with your brother Joe. Unfortunately, a new job
            leaves you with less free time.
          </p>

            Using your skills as a programmer you decide to make your surrounding
            a little bit smarter. You head to Home Depot to buy some Philips Hue
            light bulbs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whenever The Mets are about to play you want to make sure that the
            mood is set. You write a program that changes all the lights in your
            house to glow orange and blue. Also, you want to receive a text
            message letting you know that the game is about to start.

            Which APIs could you use to build your program?
