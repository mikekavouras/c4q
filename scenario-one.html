          <h1>Instagram Vacation Viewer</h1>

          <p>
            You go on a lot of vacations. On each vacation you like to come up
            with a nickname that captures the essence of the trip
            (#bestiesroadtrip2015).
          </p>

          <p>
            Every time you post a photo to Instagram you make sure to include
            the nickname as a hashtag along with the location at which the photo
            was taken.
          </p>

          <p>
            You decide it would be cool to build a website that displays your
            trips on a map using pins to represent your photos.
          </p>

            Which APIs and endpoints could you use to build your website?
          </b></p>
