          <h1>Instagram Vacation Viewer</h1>

          <p>
            You go on a lot of vacations. For each vacation that you go on you
            like to come up with a nickname that captures the experience
            (#bestiesroadtrip2015).
          </p>

          <p>
            Every time you post a photo to Instagram you make sure to include
            this nickname as a hashtag, along with the location at which the
            photo was taken.
          </p>

          <p>
            You decide that it would be cool to build website that displays
            your trip on a map, with each Instagram photo represented by 1 pin.
          </p>

            Which API's and endpoints could you use to build your website?
          </b></p>
