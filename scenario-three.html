          <br>

          <p>
            You've been tasked with building an application that helps users
            avoid people they'd rather not see. After much thought you realize
            that the best approach is to compare your current location to
            that of your "friends." You don't want to rely on proprietary data
            because that means user growth and that takes a long time.
          </p>

          <p>
            You've assessed the main social networks and you've decided that
            Foursquare, Instagram, and Twitter will provide you with the most
            up-to-date location data.
          </p>

          <p><b>
            Which API endpoints from Foursquare, Instagram, and Twitter could
            you use to build your application?
          </b></p>
