          <br>

          <p>
            You pride yourself on your robust knowledge of the deepest cuts.
            You can't stand the inferior quality of digital music and insist
            that your friends come over to listen to your latest vinyls.
          </p>

          <p>
            You decide that you'd like to build a game that uses various "top"
            lists from around the internet (top 100 all time, top 50 pop, etc).
            The game is basic: you see one album cover at a time, but its partially
            masked by a record sleeve. The goal is to guess the record.
          </p>

          <p><b>
            Equipped with nothing more than album name and the respective artist
            name, which API's and endpoints would you use to build your game?
